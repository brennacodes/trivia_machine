### About the Trivia Machine®®
The Trivia Machine®®® was created for "funzies"(read *masochistic pleasure*) as a ridiculous extension to the "[Flash Cards](https://github.com/brennacodes/flash_cards/blob/main/README.md)" project during Mod 1 at Turing School using TDD and DRY principles.

I wanted to push myself to create something that was a little more dynamic and interactive than the Flashcards shown, and this is the result.

#### A few fun facts:
- The game is programmed to accept partial, but still correct answers. For example "skin" for "The skin", or "einstein" for "Albert Eisntein."
- The game will let you play a mix of categories or a specific category.
- You can quit at any time and the game will output either your score or a goodbye message if you haven't officially started a round yet.


Hope you enjoy!
