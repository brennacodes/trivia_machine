### About the Trivia Machine®®
The Trivia Machine®®® was created for "funzies"(read *masochistic pleasure*) as a ridiculous extension to the "[Flash Cards](https://github.com/brennacodes/flash_cards/blob/main/README.md)" project during Mod 1 at Turing School using TDD and DRY principles.

I wanted to push myself to create something that was a little more dynamic and interactive than the Flashcards shown, and this is the result.

Hope you enjoy!
