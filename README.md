#### About the Trivia Machine®®
The Trivia Machine®®® was created for "funzies"(read *masochistic pleasure*) as a ridiculous extension to the "Flash Cards" project during Mod 1 at Turing School.

I wanted to push myself to create something that was a little more dynamic and interactive than the Flashcards shown, and this is the result.

Hope you enjoy!
